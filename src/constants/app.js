    'I am a Full Stack Web Developer and UI/UX enthusiast who focuses on writing clean, elegant and efficient code.',
    `My unequivocal love for creativity ushered me to create my first html page back in 2006. I was taken aback by
    the endless possibilities and there has been no looking back ever since. I completed my B.Tech degree in Computer Science and
    Engineering from SRM University, Chennai in 2016.`,
    `I kick-started my tech career by interning at Crayon Data and was lucky enough to associate myself with Cognizant and
    Keepworks later on. As a polyglot developer, I have grabbed every possible opportunity at the workplace, to learn and hone
    my skills by working on diverse tasks ranging from designing components to deploying apps to production servers.`,
    `Apart from building web apps, I am an avid reader and a hobbyist photographer who likes to travel.`
