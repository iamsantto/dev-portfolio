    the endless possibilities and there has been no looking back ever since. I completed my B.Tech degree in Computer Science and
    Engineering from SRM University, Chennai in 2016.`,
    `I kick-started my tech career by interning at Crayon Data and was lucky enough to associate myself with Cognizant and
    Keepworks later on. As a web developer, I have grabbed every possible opportunity at the workplace, to learn and hone
    my skills by working on diverse tasks ranging from designing components to deploying apps to production servers.`,
